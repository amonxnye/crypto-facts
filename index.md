## Crypto Fudge


Cryptozealots try to muzzle anyone critically dissecting the flaws of crypto-currencies by accusing him of spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty & Doubt) rather than rebut the critique. But cryptos engage instead in constant daily FUDGE. So anytime they call u FUD call them back FUDGE

Stop the FUDGE! Crypto-zealots engage in daily FUDGE: vaporware, manipulation, obfuscation, bullsh-t

FUDGE: present or deal with (something) in a vague, noncommittal, or inadequate way, especially so as to conceal the truth or mislead. Synonyms:evade, avoid, dodge, skirt,  duck

Scalability with decentralization and security is crypto-FUDGE!

Decentralization is crypto-FUDGE as exchanges, miners and developers are ALL becoming centralized oligopolies. Stop the crypto-FUDGE!

Efficient, low cost, fair, clean crypto-trading is crypto-FUDGE. Rather manipulation, wash trading , spoofing, pump and dump schemes, suckering of the Bagholders by the crypto-Whales are the constant reality of daily crypto-trading. Stop the crypto-FUDGE!

Stop the crypto-coiners bullsh-t! Anytime they scream FUD when you unveil their non-sense, pipe dreams, manipulation, obfuscation do call them for what they are: total FUDGE, crypto-FUDGE!  Stop the Crypto-FUDGE! #STOPCRYPTOFUDGE

## Ethereum


"All of the top DApps are still very much about speculation of value. Decentralized exchanges, casino games, pyramid schemes...are all around speculation". No useful DApp & the industry doesn't even clean up criminal pyramid schemes. Shame on Ethereum!

## Pump and Dump


Crypto eco-system includes 1000s of chat rooms where cryptocrazies scheme daily to manipulate crypto prices: pump and dump; wash trades; spoofing; etc. All practices that are officially ILLEGAL/CRIMINAL. Mother Of All Scams.  So why is SEC asleep at the wheel & does nothing?

Another Whalepool recording scheming manipulation of crypto-currencies. A trader admitted personally to me: "it is not "illegal" to front run and pump and dump as these are not "securities" & thus not subject to securities laws". What a sleazy chutzpah!

## ICOs

ICOs are indeed the mother of all scams.  81% of them are Scams to begin with. Another 11% are Failed or Gone Dead. Even most of the 8% that make it to an exchange often cause large market losses to investors as they are weak, flimsy, vaporware ventures

Only 95% of ICO ideas are shit? I say 99%....
