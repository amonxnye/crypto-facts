## Pump and Dump, Wash Trades, Spoofing - Illegal & Criminal Crypto Price Manipulations

Crypto eco-system includes thousands of chat rooms where cryptocrazies scheme daily to manipulate crypto prices: pump and dump; wash trades; spoofing; etc. All practices that are officially ILLEGAL/CRIMINAL. Mother of all scams.  So why is SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) asleep at the wheel and does nothing?

Another whalepool recording scheming manipulation of crypto-currencies. A trader admitted personally to me: "it is not "illegal" to front run and pump and dump as these are not "securities" and thus not subject to securities laws". What a sleazy chutzpah!

## Crypto Fudge - Shut Up! Crypto Zealot Cultists Accept No Arguments or Critiques     


Stop the FUDGE! Crypto-zealots engage in daily FUDGE: vaporware, manipulation, obfuscation, bullshit

FUDGE: present or deal with (something) in a vague, noncommittal, or inadequate way, especially so as to conceal the truth or mislead. Synonyms: evade, avoid, dodge, skirt,  duck
-- [6 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/993159635237416965)


Cryptozealots try to muzzle anyone critically dissecting the flaws of crypto-currencies by accusing him of spreading FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) rather than rebut the critique. But cryptos engage instead in constant daily FUDGE.
So anytime they call you FUD call them back FUDGE.

Decentralization is crypto-FUDGE as exchanges, miners and developers are ALL becoming centralized oligopolies. Stop the crypto-FUDGE!

Efficient, low cost, fair, clean crypto-trading is crypto-FUDGE. Rather manipulation, wash trading , spoofing, pump and dump schemes, suckering of the bagHODLers by the crypto-whales are the constant reality of daily crypto-trading. Stop the crypto-FUDGE!

When they use the term FUD to shut you up as they have no real arguments against crypto-critiques, call their bluff and call them FUDGE, as they are only big baloney crypto-FUDGE.

## Bitcoin - Rich Getting Richer

There are about 1 million holders of Bitcoin; 47 individuals hold about 30%, another 900 hold a further 20%, the next 10 000 about 25% and another million about 20%, with 5% being lost. So 0.1% represent about half the holdings of Bitcoin and 1% close to 80%
-- [11 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/995004255114326017)

The distribution of Bitcoin holdings looks much like the distribution of wealth in North Korea
and makes the China's and even the United States' wealth distribution look like that of a workers' paradise
Bitcoin. Gini Coefficient: 0.88

How Bitcoin is like North Korea

## Bitcoin - Greater Fools

Bill Gates says he would bet against bitcoin if he could as it is a "greater fool" investment.

"As an asset class, you're not producing anything and so you shouldn't expect it to go up. It's kind of a pure 'greater fool theory' type of investment".

## Ethereum - The Decentralized Future of Apps?

"All of the top decentralized apps are still very much about speculation of value. Decentralized exchanges, casino games, pyramid schemes... are all around speculation". No useful decentralized app and the industry doesn't even
clean up criminal pyramid schemes. Shame on Ethereum!
-- [6 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/993127057151246336)


50% of decentralized apps are decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
that have no liquidity and transact useless tokens,
25% are silly games such as cryptokitties and 20% are ponzi pyramid schemes. So get the real facts on the junky "use cases" of Ethereum and stop living in your bubble. Can't bullshit me as I know my facts.

## Centralized Mining - All Your Free Lottery Money are Belong to Us

Proof of work leads to miners' concentration whether it is ZCash or Bitcoin or Ethereum.
The move of some cryptocurrencies to proof of stake will make that concentration risk even worse.
One miner is already controlling 40% of Ethereum mining.
And that oligopoly power will get worse with proof of stake.

## Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) - The Mother of All Scams


Call Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) for their true name: Initial Coin Scams (ICSs).
81% of them are scams to begin with. Another 11% are dead or failed.
So barely 8% trade on an exchange and most of those are non-compliant securities skirting all securities laws
-- [11 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/994882522885623809)


ICOs are indeed the mother of all scams.  81% of them are scams to begin with. Another 11% are failed or gone dead. Even most of the 8% that make it to an exchange often cause large market losses to investors as they are weak, flimsy, vaporware ventures
-- [5 May 2018](https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/992999999440019457)


Only 95% of ICO ideas are shit? I say 99%....

## Tokens, Tokens, Tokens - Run Your Own Cartel

Read my [Project Syndicate Op-Ed](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ico-cryptocurrency-scams-by-nouriel-roubini-2018-05) on why tokens are non-compliant scams
and why only reason to issue tokens can be to form an illegal cartel to gouge consumers.
Study your Economics 101 before spewing this silly nonsense on every business
needing its own currency.

## CryptoKitties - A Decentralized App Success Story?

Apart from being a dumb game CryptoKitties has low and falling transactions.
Compared to any good video game it has transaction volume that is 0.001% than any game.
So dumb and failing. And that is the best success story that cryptozealots
can cite for a decentralized app. With success like this...

## Payments, Payments, Payments

Two currency conversion and THREE costly transaction costs. Given volatility no one truly using crypto for transaction purposes would hold it; they would convert it back into fiat to avoid volatility and market risk.

So called crypto-"currencies" aren't a means of payment (way too costly with three transaction costs), aren't a unit of account and aren't a stable or safe or secure store of value. Thus, they are NOT currencies. They are the mother of all rip-offs!

## Crypto-Utopia - The Future of Money

I accept the correction. So the Flintstones had a more developed monetary system with a real money than the stone age barter system recommended by the crypto-supporters of a world of tokenization. So the Flintstones are financially more advanced and sophisticated than the cryptos!

## Crypto-Utopia - The End Of (Credit) Bubbles

> Austrian Maximalist writes:

> A true cryptocurrency is immune from bank runs and credit cycles.
> Only the fiat price is impacted.

There were huge asset and credit bubbles well before fiat currencies and central banks. And run against such bubbles. So same can occur in a hypothetical crypto world where there is no fiat currency.

Actually in a crypto world economic/financial disasters will be more virulent/frequent than
today as, before fiat money and central banks, bubbles were bigger and more disastrous.
Central banks were created to avoid runs via lender of last resort support.
Crypto can't do that.

## Drug Trafficking, Embezzlement, Money Laundering - Business As Usual

Regulators will soon crack down on use of cryptocurrencies in illegal and criminal activities.
AML (Anti Money Laundering)/KYC (Know Your Customer) and securities laws will be enforced. As US Treasury Secretary Mnuchin recently said: We can't allow cryptocurrencies to become the next Swiss bank account.
